# Systems Independent Research Course

## Introduction

This GitHub repository provides an overview of the research and work conducted during the Systems Independent Research Course. Under the guidance of Dr. Robert Ricci, we explored various aspects of system variability and its impact on system reproducibility, with a particular focus on Memory, Storage, and Network.

Our research efforts were instrumental in the publication of a research paper titled "Avoiding the Ordering Trap in Systems Performance Measurement," which has contributed significantly to the field of systems performance analysis. Specifically, our work aided in the detection of outliers and improved system performance accuracy.

## Research Highlights

- **System Variability:** We delved into the intricate aspects of system variability, comprehensively examining its effects on system reproducibility. Understanding these nuances was crucial for our subsequent work.

- **Memory, Storage, and Network:** Our research specifically focused on the three critical components of system performance: Memory, Storage, and Network. Analyzing how variations in these elements affected system behavior was a core aspect of our research.

- **Publication:** Our findings and insights formed the foundation of a significant research paper, which serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.

## Serverless Systems Exploration

As part of our research, we ventured into the realm of serverless computing, exploring platforms such as Apache OpenWhisk and AWS Lambda. Our aim was to accurately benchmark these serverless systems on different platforms using the SeBS benchmarking suite.

### Key Activities

- **Benchmarking:** We rigorously benchmarked Apache OpenWhisk and AWS Lambda to gain insights into their performance characteristics. This benchmarking process allowed us to identify strengths and weaknesses in each platform.

- **Custom Features:** In our pursuit of accuracy, we extended the functionality of the SeBS benchmarking suite by implementing custom features. These additions enhanced the suite's capabilities for benchmarking serverless systems.
