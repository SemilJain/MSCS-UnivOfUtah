## Course Achievements

Grade - A-

Got to learn about the various Data Structures, Algorithms and Optimize their time and space complexity in detail through lectures and assignments:

1) Successfully designed and analyzed the correctness and efficiency of algorithms that make use of techniques like divide and conquer, dynamic programming, greedy strategies and local search.
2) Analyzed optimization problems from an approximation perspective and design algorithms with guarantees on closeness to optimality.
3) Made use of randomness in the design and analysis of algorithms, including the use oftechniques like random assignment and estimation using sampling, and analyzed quantities such as the expected running time and failure probability.
4) Was able to formulate problems in the language of mathematical optimization, specifically as integer linear programs, and develop efficient algorithms using relaxations.
5) Understood notions such as NP completeness, the P versus NP question, and be able to establish intractability of previously unseen problems.
