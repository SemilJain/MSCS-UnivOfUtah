## Course Achievements

Grade - A

During this course, I had the opportunity to dive deep into the essential principles and concepts that form the foundation of modern operating systems. Here's a summary of what I achieved and learned:

Significance of xv6

I now understand why the course utilized xv6, a re-implementation of Unix Version 6. xv6's size and design made it an ideal teaching tool:

It effectively illustrated the core principles of operating systems without overwhelming complexity.

xv6's manageable codebase allowed me to explore and comprehend the inner workings of an operating system.

The structural similarities between xv6 and modern OS kernels enhanced my understanding of contemporary operating systems like Linux.

Virtual Memory
I gained a comprehensive understanding of virtual memory systems, including the mechanics of paging and segmentation. This knowledge has given me insights into how modern operating systems manage memory resources efficiently.

Kernel and User Mode
I explored the crucial distinction between kernel mode and user mode, gaining an appreciation for how operating systems maintain privilege levels and protect critical system resources.

System Calls
The course provided me with a solid grasp of system calls and their role as an interface for user programs to interact with the operating system kernel. I can now appreciate the mechanisms behind various system calls.

Threads
I learned about threads and how they facilitate concurrent execution within a single process. This knowledge is essential for understanding how modern applications can efficiently utilize multi-core processors.

Context Switches
Understanding context switches, a fundamental operation for multitasking in operating systems, has broadened my knowledge of how the OS manages the execution of multiple processes.

Interrupts
I explored the world of interrupts and their significance in handling asynchronous events and managing hardware resources. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the responsiveness of operating systems.

Interprocess Communication
The course equipped me with techniques for interprocess communication and synchronization between processes. I can now design systems that communicate efficiently and avoid race conditions.

Coordination of Concurrent Activities
I mastered the art of coordinating concurrent activities, including synchronization mechanisms and deadlock avoidance strategies. This knowledge is valuable for building robust and efficient software systems.

Interface Between Software and Hardware
I gained insights into how operating systems interface with underlying hardware components. This understanding has deepened my appreciation for the role of the OS in managing hardware resources.
