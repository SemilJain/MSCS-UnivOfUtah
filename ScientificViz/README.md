## Course Achievements

Grade - A

## Runnerup in the Scientific Viz project contest held in the university

Visualization is important to most areas of science, engineering, and medicine. We learned important topics common to many areas of visualization, while at the same
time, allowing us to learn specific techniques and/or applications via a visualization project. Scientific visualization can be approached from an abstract and/or from a practical perspective. In this course, we focused on applications in science, engineering, and medicine, while at the same time learning some underlying theory.

1) Learned commonly used algorithms and techniques in scientific visualization
2) Saw and discussed examples of visualization in a variety of fields
3) Was able to critique the effectiveness of a scientific visualization
4) Was able to efficiently use the ParaView scientific visualization software system
5) Know where to locate further visualization resources
6) Was exposed to current research issues in scientific visualization,
7) Completed a project in scientific visualization
