## Course Achievements

Grade - A

Graduate-level research-oriented course, which covered both classic and cutting-edge topics in the area of software security. It helped us understand software problems in not only traditional binary executables but also emerging mobile applications, cyber-physical systems and Blockchain platforms through lectures, labs, and projects.

1) Evaluated the concept, categorization, and impact of software security problems and countermeasures
2) Integrated appropriate defense mechanisms into practical systems
3) Validated security choices based on impact, cost, and efficiency
4) Analyzed software bugs and malware activities with manual reverse engineering and automated analysis tools
5) Implemented custom analysis tools to enable dedicated software vulnerability analysis
